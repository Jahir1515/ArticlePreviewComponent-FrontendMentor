# Article-preview-component
This is a frontend mentor of a article preview component
## Developing Experience 
I used basic frontend technologies (html, css and js) to develop this page. 
### Challenges 
I experienced some challenges during the working process. The main challenge I experienced was to adapt the design from the mobile to the desktop view with diferent methods and trying to not break the global structure from the html and the design.
### Learning
I learned how to use toggle method to alternate between classes and use it in click events to show a different content from the page.
